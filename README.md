dotfiles.git
============
Clone and run this on a new EC2 instance running Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS to
configure your `bash` and `emacs` development environment as follows:

```sh
sudo apt-get install curl
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tejovanthn/dotfiles/master/setup.sh | sudo sh
```

See also http://github.com/startup-class/setup to install prerequisite
programs. If all goes well, in addition to a more useful prompt, now you can
do `emacs -nw hello.js` and hitting `C-c!` to launch an interactive SSJS
REPL, among many other features. See the
[Startup Engineering Video Lectures 4a/4b](https://class.coursera.org/startup-001/lecture/index)
for more details.
